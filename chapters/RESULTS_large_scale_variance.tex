\begin{itemize}
\item to assess the accuracy of current neural modelling work we explored:
\item variance in models
\item variance in experiments,  
\item variance in the combined set of models and experiments.
\end{itemize}
    % combine this discussion with model repurposing discussion.


\subsection{Cortical Model and Cortical Experiment Agreement}
Models and experimental measurements can agree and disagree in many different ways, therefore we would like to identify important sources of model/data disagreement. Better awareness of model/data disagreement informs a related question: "In  cortical neuron models which segmented pieces of a voltage recording waveform should the optimizer act on?"

\subsection{Features} Consider a voltage recording at the location of the membrane of a neuron. Teams of researchers have already segmented voltage recordings into labelled sections, each section has a classification that is based on the shape of waveform in a limited region. Rather than specifying by name each measurement it is often useful to refer collectively to these measurable shapes as "features". In multivariate analysis I look at hundreds of these waveform features. 

Specifically below, I describe some neuronal model features that agreed well with experiments, and some features that disagreed less well.

\subsubsection{A Fitted Model May not Generalize}
A fitted model may not generalize to current stimulus at higher or lower current strengths, Unless the model is fitted with constraints informed by those different experiments. As discussed above, the true FI curve is described by a gradient and a bias. When one fits to both the slope and the bias of the FI curve, it means that the model will at least be able to recapitulate the right number of spikes for  a given current strength. %Although this does not necessarily mean that the shapes of the each individual spike will agree between model and experiment. 
% important for network modellers as I discuss elsewhere.

The utility of the Rheobase approach is to demonstrate a work flow. Its possible that some researchers are interested in modelling single spiking behavior efficiently, however, in the context of network simulations, one may be better of fitting to a multispiking sweep.

In reduced neuronal It was found that the electrical properties of cells:
 (Rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant,Resting Potential, Capicitance)

 did not encode the above threshold spiking behavior of neurons, when neurons were undergoing a multispiking stimulus regime.

Which fits generalize better? Which tests have more predictive power?

I fitted an adaptive exponential model, and an Izhikevich model to experimentally obtained values for input resistance, time constant, resting membrane potential, and rheobase.

Surprisingly fitting to essential electrical properties of neuron membranes was distinctly different from fitting the cells directly to the FIcurve, as I will show below. 

Specifically in in-vitro cell  cell with Allen specimen id $482493761$ injecting a current of $110*pA$ evokes a spike count of $3$, by contrast in an Izhikevich model fitted against criteria listed above, the model produces $33$ spikes, and not $3$ spikes, in otherwords, essential electrical properties did not predict firing rate very well in the model.

In the in vitro cell with Allen specimen id 471819401, $290 pA$ causes $20$ spikes,
in the optimized Adaptive Exponential model $290pA$ caused only $5$ spikes. 

Motivated by these unexpected discrepancies, I produced a smaller sub group of tests consisting of rheobase and FISlope only, as the discrepancies show that cell capacitance, input resistance, and time constant are generally conflicted with FI curve proportions in in-silico cell models. I discuss a group of canonical tests. These are tests that employ cross-validation, to reveal tests that generalize versus tests that promote ``over-fitting". The first members of a generalizable and canonical set of tests are likely to be the FIcurve and Rheobase tests.

One can imagine that in cells that have been optimized to and FIslope rheobase only, that current spike count relationship might be more accurate and faithful to spike count aspects of experiments.

Another way of writing this is that fitting a model to electrical properties of cells, does not
guarantee that the cell is fitted to above threshold behavior, at current injection virtual experiments with larger amounts of injected current.
A model fitted to one "sweep" is a model of only that sweep. 

If you apply the sweep fitted model to a different current injection value, you will not get the expected waveform shape fitted.
because even though one may have optimized to the shape of a single spike, and the membrane time constant, and input resistance should have a bearing
 on spike width and spike height respectively. Since spike width is dependant on membrane time constant, and input resistance, you 
 would expect that spike frequency and therefore firing rate, should be proportionately related to 
 to the membrane spike width, and therefore membrane capacitance. However, in reduced neuronal models, this was found
 to be not strictly the case.

 The Rheobase value is the biggest determinant of how current injection values map onto spike counts.


 Arguably then only the rheobase current injection value is important for fitting to Reduced Neuronal Models in order to make networks of Reduced Neuronal cells behave more realistically.
 It is unclear, however, what the relationship is between synaptic current and electrode current. Synaptic current is distributed, but electrode current is focused on a single point.
 If both are distal to the axon hillock, both synaptic current, and injected currents may behave in a similar way.


These model parameters do not encode the spike frequency.
you didn't optimize to the spike count at different injection values.

Therefore in order to make realistic network models that make use of reduced models, 
one should have a firing rate, and some sweep data, of cellular behavior with the same spike frequency.
one can then fit simple multi-spiking waveform measurements to the models.

Surprisingly some types of spiking information, like spike rate, and multispiking height, spike adaption.
Are easier for reduced models to fit. I show this in some simulated data, virtual experiments.

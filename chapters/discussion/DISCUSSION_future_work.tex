\section{Future Work}
Because of the benefits of the NeuroML model specification, data fitted models should be downloadable in a NeuroML format. NeuroML is simulator agnostic, descriptions of the optimized models will be more shareable, if they are not pinned down to implementations used here. Neuron modellers likely already have their favorite simulator framework. Optimized NeuroML can can be executed on any mainstream simulator. 

The next most obvious improvements to the optimizer is simple. In this work I reveal a serious problem caused by insufficiently accurate rheobase calculations where small sources of rounding error  propagate into some other measurements. % I may not have labored the case %P where they produce large detectable oscillations. 
Despite there being negative consequences of this error for the signal sources that guide optimization, there is still a mandate for models with different preferred currents to participate in testing. Preferred current searches are easily separable from Genetic Algorithms, meaning that a preferred current search can occur in an isolated part of a different algorithm where it will not act as the basis for electrical measurements. Over the course of a genetic algorithms search a fixed current can be applied to all models, allowing electrical measurements to be grounded to a stable value. Genetic algorithms can easily be nested inside each other, its easy to conceive of a situation, where an inner GA evaluates model fitness according to fixed currents, and an outer GA changes the fixed current that is used on each inner GA batch. The result of such a process should be a collection of optimized cells, that where obtained according to a different fixed current injection strength. %If one optimized model is clearly better, then two things about the model are revealed. What is the cell models preferred current, and what how well did it fit the tests? This scheme is also different in that it treats current injection strength as a model parameter, and not a emergent feature of the model.

%cause of this finite precision error, 
%When model parameters are inserted into NeuroML cell model definitions, NeuroML encoded models become operational. These NeuroML encodings will if possible be uploaded into NeuroML-DB, where they will be more readily find-able by the neuron modelling community
% Such files can be used as network components, and they confidently utilized and exchanged, as such files represent a higher degree of rigor. Since there are two classes of model fits, some models are better suited fitted to network modelling and others are better suited to single cell modelling, this is because, by fitting cell models to FI curves, a lot of other realistic electrical behavior that is incompatible with the FI fit diminishes.

At least for the Izhikevich, model links to the reference models, can also be provided.

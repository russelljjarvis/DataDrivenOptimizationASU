We built faster python implementations of two neuronal models (Izhi model and adaptive Exponential model). One of the implementations was based on MATLAB forward euler implementation of the Izhi model, another implementation of the Adaptive Exponential model came from vectorized python code, which was relatively slow.

Because I was able to use a tool \cite(numba) enables In Time compilation(JIT) , both of these models perform faster than standard neuron simulator versions in brian2 and NEURON.

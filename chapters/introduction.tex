\section{Why model the brain?}
Diseases of the brain are very widespread and cost world governments a significant amount of money \citep{who}.
The 2015 Global Burden of Disease study estimates that about a third of the population worldwide is affected by mental or neurological disorders across their lifespans.
Disorders of the brain rank among the leading causes of ill-health and disability and account for 35\% of Europeâ€™s total disease burden with a yearly cost of 800 billion euros, of which 60\% are related to direct health care and non-medical costs \citep{who}. 
\subsection{Computational Models}
In addition to producing actions and goal directed behaviors, the mammal nervous system filters and processes signals in steps that are increasingly understood at mechanical and algorithmric levels \citep{marr1976understanding}.
The recent success of ``deep-neural networks" and ``recurrent neural networks" is due in part to the simple application of rudimentary neural design principles to networks of computational units.
Innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) have been achieved by recapitulating just a few such algorithms observed in the brain.
For example, artificial neural networks trained to navigate a landscape spontaneously exhibit the emergence of nodes (cell analogues) exhibiting the same behavior as so-called ``grid" and ``place" cells that encode spatial location in mammalian brains \citep{banino2018vector}.

However, further progress in both human health and artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to require a greater understanding of how the brain actually works.
Biophysically realistic computational models of neurons and neural circuits have emerged as useful tools to elucidate brain function in health and disease.
Developing and testing these models may be required to give programmers and engineers insight into the neural principles that underlie human learning and reasoning, so that these principles can be implemented in an electronic substrate.
Because improvements in AI directly contribute to improvements in robotics, and because computers and robots can perform some unsafe and repetitive tasks with high precision, substantial gains in global economic productivity are at stake.
AI may also help to push the frontier of scientific research itself.
%big claims too hard to defend, and to solve or exacerbate existential problems facing humanity.
Our medical understanding of the brain and digital implementations of brain algorithms would likely improve if existing models for neuron and neural circuits were more tractable, both conceptually and computationally.

In this thesis, I describe and document tools I developed that improve the speed and accuracy of some classes of neural models. The speed improvements come from the implementation of a low-level model simulation, largely relying on existing research. I also identify and exploit some opportunities for faster model dispatch and simulation. The accuracy improvements, which constitute most of the novelty here, derive from application of optimization techniques to improve the agreement between models and corresponding ``wet lab" experiments in neurons.
By improving single cell models, these tools will also serve as a basis for improved neural circuit models, of which many neuron types are among the components.
Since network models many consist of many thousands (or more) of cell models, both speed and accuracy are essential.

\subsection{Simulation as an Experimental Platform}
The human brain is inaccessible to many experiments for technical and ethical reasons.
Neuroscience relies instead on ``model systems" for understanding the human brain.
One such model system is the animal model (of which there are many), chosen due to biological similarities to the organization of the human brain, and the relatively smaller ethical issues associated with experimentation.
However, animal models have limitations which can make them scientifically unfavorable
Animal models often involve years of investment, genetic engineering, complex surgery, or complicated behavioral learning paradigms.
Many things can go wrong while developing an assay, potentially ruining a costly experiment, and diminishing years of work.
Furthermore, experiments are still limited by technology; arbitrary control of neural activity is generally not tractable.
Therefore causality and identifiability are still major issues.

For example, in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible to investigate rodent behavior for Alzheimer's symptoms, and to attempt to identify associated changes in physiology, such as changes in cell-specific firing rates or circuit dynamics.
However, the density of placement of recording electrode arrays is very limited, and so the read out of brain activity from electrode arrays is sparse.
Immune reactivity and glial scarring may undermine the fidelity of the underlying system, and make such recordings more difficult.
In \emph{in vitro} recordings, recorded cells are susceptible to ``run-down" \citep{colquhoun1994ion}, where the membrane of the recorded neuron membrane its ionic complement changes too much from its \emph{in vivo} conditions. 
Cell run-down creates a small time window for learning about cells in animal experiments, fortunately, cell-run down is obviously not a problem for \emph{in-silico} models.

\emph{In-silico} model systems, e.g. computational models represent an alternative approach.
Rather than simply thinking of computational models as systems of differential equations used to describe and represent the biological processes under investigation, we can think of them as experimental platforms.
Much detail will inevitably lost, and a main assumption is that the important features of the biological processes are reflected in electrical activity, e.g. changes in membrane potential, and that other details abstracted out of the model, for example long-term changes to genes and protein expression, are not essential to understand the problem at hand.
This assumption may be reasonable for investigations of short-time scale phenomenon (e.g. instantaneous responses to stimuli) but not longer-time scales (e.g: glial cell re-organisation associated with learning new skills \citep{draganski2008training}).

However, all model systems are imperfect; the \emph{in vitro} brain slice is not an \emph{in vivo} brain, and lacks many putatively important features of a real brain, such as long-range connectivity or even complete axonal or dendritic trees.
The limitations expressed in the paragraph above may limit measurement quality.
Ultimately, the question is whether results from the model system will translate to the biological system, and how and whether a good simulation platform can outperform an \emph{in vitro} animal model system is an open question.
To achieve this, it is likely that the simulation platform will need to utilize model components as faithful to the biological system as possible, and thus it is important that reduced neural models are the most faithful to the cell behavior they represent. 

\section{Why Model Neurons?}
The idea that neurons are the fundamental computational units of the brain dates to the 19th century \citep{shepherd2015foundations,jones1999golgi}.
A large fraction of computational models have thus included the neuron, at some level of abstraction.  
Conventionally, each neuron has been regarded as an independent generator of events (e.g. synaptic conductance's or currents in postsynaptic neurons) and selective receiver of the same events, these inputs summed in some fashion across time and space. 

Although cortical neurons have many interconnections \citep{ball2014rich}, these connections themselves are plastic, changing with development and learning.
In contrast, the dynamics of the neurons themselves are typically considered less variable over most relevant timescales, i.e. the parameters of the underlying equations may be fixed.
Consequently the rules governing these neurons are assumed to be static over short time-scales.
whicat the center of modeling efforts, and letting only synapses change over time, one can still model a large number of relevant neuroscience problems.
But just because the modeled neurons can be approximated with static rules does not mean they should be considered monolithic: there are many thousands of different classes of neurons, each with its own idiosyncratic dynamics and connectivity.
And many such classes might be essential for the generation of even simple behaviors.
Therefore understanding the brain may require the ability to accurately model not just neurons per se, but many kinds of neurons.

Alternatively, one could model subcellular processes to get an even more accurate picture of biology than is obtained from considering the neuron as the basic unit of the brain.
However, this approach greatly increases computational complexity and is even more limited by the availability of experimental data (or theory). It is an open question whether such detail improves the predictive or explanatory accuracy of models anyway.
Simplifying assumptions are often needed in modeling, and the simplifying assumption that I choose here is to abstract away these subcellular processes into a small number of state equations that describe observable physiology at the whole cell level.

One could also model above the level of neurons, by creating mean-field and population models of brain tissue.
However, this makes it difficult to understand intra-circuit computations occurring in local circuits, or to understand how a change to e.g. a single conductance might affect a behavior.
Some also argue that spiking is necessary to reproduce some kinds of population dynamics, especially those that evade intuitive understanding.
And model-as-simulation-platform is less compelling if the outcomes of the simulations are obvious in advance.

In AI, spiking neural networks are useful for distinguishing sequential features in temporal signals.
Spiking and temporal feature discrimination are necessary for "online-learning".
%A machine learning paradigm where training and validation are overlapping and ongoing.
In online-learning, neural networks are constantly being remodeled in response to constant and changing signals from the environment
%In this way a model of the external world that is fit in the morning, may become invalidated because of radical changes in the local environment by night-time, just like in mammals. For a direct analogy, consider a driver-less car that fatally crashes. A crash caused by a driverless car would cause an instant re-evaluation of the fitness of self driving algorithms. 



% - How are neurons modeled (i.e. math and equations)
\subsection{Conductance-based Models}
Conductance-based models are mathematical representations of the electrical and chemical behavior of semi-permeable neuronal membranes.
The phospho-lipid membrane of neurons, otherwise a insulative capacitor, contains a variety of conductive pores (ion channels), each permitting the passage of specific ions at specific rates.
These rates are determined by free energy gradients, jointly determined by transmembrane ionic concentration gradients (entropy) and on the transmembrane voltage changes adjacent to the channel (potential energy). Conductance-based models use ordinary differential equations to represent the balance of currents and the kinetics for the gating of the channels, where these models differ in their representation of cell geometry. Some conductance-based models represent an isoelectric patch of membrane (in this case the model is abstract and dispenses with the notion of space in nervous tissue).
When the spatial aspects of the electrical properties of a neuron are of interest, conductance based models can be combined with a multi-compartment framework where the geometry of the neuron is "modelled", but it is approximated using coupled compartments that create systems of branching patterns \citep{rall1962electrophysiology, hodgkin1952quantitative}.

\cite{rall1962electrophysiology} took the numerical methods used for modelling heat and electrical conductance in cables and showed that similar equations could be used to accurately predict current flow in a cable representing a neuron dendrite or axon.
This cable equation forms the basis for the electrical properties in the multi-compartment approach.

%\begin{equation}

%\end{equation}
%\end{center}
%\begin{equation}
%I_{ionic}=\\
%g_{Na}(V)[V(t)-V_{Na}]+\\
%g_{K}(V)[V(t)-V_{K}]+\\g_{L}[V(t)-V_{L}] 
%\end{equation}
In the context of modelling realistic morphologies, conductance based, multicompartment models are typically slow to solve because they contain many (tens or more) coupled differential equations which must be solved at every discrete location across the neuron.
These locations (segments or compartments) may have unique parameters, which are as simple as segment diameter (corresponding to e.g. tapering of dendrites) or as complex as distance-dependent changes in the distribution of specific ionic conductances.
Many of these fine structural variations are incorporated into biophysically-detailed brain models.  
Because the geometric structure of the morphology affects the neural firing dynamics, even a generic set of principles may result in distinct dynamics across different realizations of the same class of neuron.  
Clearly, there multicompartment modeling brings a large cost in simulation performance and in generalizability.

\subsection{Reduced Models}
Conductance-based models can be complex--both conceptually through implementation details and in computational demands--so it is common to employ a variety of simplifications that retain the general input/output behavior of the full model.
These ``reduced models" ignore the precise neuron biophysics, usually retaining only the medium-time-scale (milliseconds to tens of milliseconds) dynamics, by assuming that anything faster occurs instantaneously and anything slower can be ignored.
The 3D structure of biological cells is reduced to a point onto which currents impinge and voltages evolve over time. There is a great diversity of biological neurons, all of which differ substantially in their electrical behavior \citep{quadrato2017cell}. There are a few different classes of general purpose neuronal models that can reproduce these different types of electrical behaviours, given appropriate parameterizations of the models. A selection of key reduced models is described below.

%\end{displaymath}
The Adaptive Exponential (AdExp) IF model \citep{brette2005adaptive}, is another type of reduced neural model
The AdExp model is a special instance of leaky integrate and Fire model. The AdEx model most often appears with an exponential spike shape.
% I think rising phase is caused by exponential term. In Izhikevich its quadratic.
This model's instantaneous spiking rate is calculated by consulting the recent spike history in a finite time "window". 
Adaptation is achieved by looking back into the window and counting the number of spikes that occurred in the previous $10ms$, for example. 

\subsubsection{Izhikevich Model}
One existing family of neuron models, often referred to as the Izhikevich model \citep{izhikevich2003simple}, was published with parameter sets believed to produce model outputs that accurately align with a variety of outputs from experimentally derived neuron data.
Is it possible to choose parameters for the Izhikevich model that allow the electrophysiological behavior of any neuron to be capture?.
The original formulation of that model involves the integration of a quadratic function:

%\begin{displaymath}
%\frac{dv}{dt}=0.04v^{2}+5v+140-u+I
%\frac{du}{dt} = a(bv-u)
%if v>=30mV,
%\end{displaymath}
% then $ v \rightarrow c + u 	\rightarrow u+ d$.
 
%%%
% Flagged by Jimmy.
%%%
 
An alternative, more versatile implementations (as used here) includes additional parameters, for example allowing the coefficients in the quadratic to vary.

The Izhikevich model and the AdEx model are both related to simple Integrate and Fire model.
The Izhikevich model accounts for the change in membrane potential, $\frac{dV_{M}}{dt}$, in response to and externally supplied current (e.g. from a patch pipette or a synaptic current), the membrane capacitance, and internal cellular mechanisms that are abstracted away.
$\frac{dV_{M}}{dt}$ in the Izhikevich model is quadratic in $V$, in contrast to the GLIF and the AdExp models which are exponential in $V$.

Typically, a network simulation is only as fast as the slowest neuron model that is part of the network, since the next updated state of the network may depend on that neuron.
Consequently, replacing biophysically detailed models with the reduced models described above may be required to complete simulations in a reasonable amount of time.
However, the accuracy of these models in representing neuron behavior is also paramount.
Yet there are no reports of large numbers of reduced models with demonstrated agreement with many characteristics of experimental data.

Because multi-compartment conductance models represent more details about the biophysical properties of the membrane, it is tempting to think that this modelling paradigm is likely to produce models that maximally agree with data, however, newer generations of simpler models such as the GLIF model, may actually be better at recapitulating some experimental measurements \citep{meunier2002playing}.


\subsection{Simulation of Reduced Models}
Although this class of model is in principle potentially fast due to the limited number of equations and state variables, python implementations of it are typically slow due to code that was written to make running populations of many neurons fast, at the expense of running single neurons. 

%For instance, Brian2, and a related tool neurodynamics, have code for running AdExp neurons, however brian2 has network c-level Cython code that interferes with DEAP python code \citep{DEAP_JMLR2012}.
%Its as if a reduced model is a black box representation of a neuron, and the reduced model is a transfer function that maps inputs to outputs. Typically reduced models are very fast to solve.\\

\section{Parameter Fitting and Model Optimization}
Model parameters dictate model behavior, but many parameters either (a) cannot be easily measured in experiments for technical reasons or (b) don't correspond to any measurable quantity.
As an example of the latter, consider any ``emergent behavior" with observables that do not map directly onto any specific model parameter.
In the transition from conductance-based models to reduced models, the number of unknown parameters of form (b) increase relative to those of form (a).
In either case, these unknown parameter values make specification of realistic models difficult.

%Model simulation corresponds to numerical approximation of the solutions to a model's differential equations to obtain the time-varying values of the state variables.
%Some of these state variables may be observable.
%In all of the reduced models described above, the only observed state variable is the membrane potential, $V$.
%Additionally, there is another state variable $I$, corresponding to somatic current injection, that is under control of the operator of the simulation experiment, and which is (for a single neuron model), independent of all other parameter values or state variables.
%If the model is simulated enough times with enough different values of $I$, it may be possible in principle to identify the values of all other parameters by observing the corresponding time-dependent trajectories of $V$.
%By analogy, it is possible to solve a system of linear equations when the number of equations is greater than the number of unknowns.

One strategy for inferring model parameters, sometimes called ``parameter-fitting", is to identify those parameter values which produce model simulation data which agree (according to some criteria) with corresponding observable experimental measurements.
For example, a common approach for approximating unknown ion channel densities is to â€˜optimizeâ€™ or iteratively simulate the model, altering the parameters systematically until the simulated time series for $V$ matches some membrane potential trace recorded under similar conditions in a neuron.

What does it mean for the simulated and experimental time series of $V$ to match?
Recall that both neuron models and neurons can be injected with specific amounts of current. Because neurons are electrically excitable, the somatic membrane potential departs from the resting membrane potential in response to current injections.
For many classes of cells, abundant experimental data exist concerning the responses (membrane potential time series) to each magnitude or shape of somatic current injection.
A crude measure of error would be to simply directly compare the model and biological time series, using the mean-squared-difference, for example.
However, because excitability reflects a non-linear transformation between input and output, this means that very small differences in input (or parameters) can have massive differences on output, especially its timing.
A single action potential shifted by a millisecond (approximately the width of one action potential) might be insignificant from a practical perspective, but produce a massive ``error" signal using mean-squared difference.
Consequently, I use an approach based on more robust statistical summaries of the membrane potential, including those believed to be meaningful in neural coding.
These are described in more detail below.

The process of optimization involves what is known as an ``inverse" problem.
A naive approach to solving this inverse optimization problem works on the principle of elimination.
A large number of unsatisfactory parameter sets must be sampled, to rule out the possibility that each candidate parameter set is not worse than some currently favored parameter set.
Doing this exhaustively, using a grid search across all combinations of parameter values with sufficient resolution, is often  computationally intractable.
Consider the Izhikevich model above.
In its most general form, it contains 10 tunable parameters.
Evaluating even 25 values of each parameter implies $25^10$ parameter sets, or nearly 100 trillion parameters sets.
Even if one million parameter sets could be checked every second, evaluating all parameter sets would require three years, where this cost grows exponentially with increases in parameter resolution or number.

Fortunately, more efficient approaches exist, but the utility depends on the shape of the so-called ``error surface".
For any specific instance of a model, with a given set of parameter values, its suitability is evaluated according to some "objective function" that compares the simulated output under one or more conditions to some corresponding experimental data.
By convention, the objective function may report this suitability as an error metric, minimal when the simulated and biological results disagree to the smallest extent possible (which may not be zero, see below).
Model ``optimization" then corresponds to finding the parameter set which minimizes this objective function. 
Because the objective function returns a measure of error, the ``error surface" corresponds to the output of the objective function for each possible set of parameter values.
Ideally, this surface is perfectly ``convex", meaning that there is a single minimum, and from any starting point one can follow some variant of a gradient descent strategy to find that minimum.  

\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}
\label{sec:genetic-algorithms}
A variety of numerical optimization techniques exist, where algorithm performance depends on the demands of the problem.
For functions with many local minima, it is often best to broadly sample the error surface, rather than attempt a ``greedy" search for the global minimum.
Several notable algorithms including genetic algorithms (GA, Figure \ref{fig:GeneticAlgOver}) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been developed to address this use case.
Both of these algorithms are able to avoid putting all of their "eggs" in one local minimum ``basket", allowing them to discover over many iterations that a lower minimum is available.
For example, given enough samples, a genetic algorithm will learn the global minimum of the Rastrigin's function, although it is very likely to sample wells of the error function at many depths on the way to the solution.

% illustrate how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) generally works.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/GA_process.png}
\caption[Schematic of Genetic Algorithm Flow]{\textbf{Schematic of Genetic Algorithm Flow.} Genetic algorithms (GA) find satisfactory solutions by incompletely sampling the solution space. The evolution of the algorithm is guided by the combined application of stochastic sampling and selective pressure. Stochastic contributions that guide GA sampling provide incentives for exploring regions beyond the local minima. Stochasticity is applied in the combined actions of cross-over and mutation. Model parameterizations are encoded as binary strings called genes. When genes breed, eligible pairs of genes are aligned and the status of a bit is exchanged at random locations.  
}
\label{fig:GeneticAlgOver}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
  
I use genetic algorithms in the work presented here, and while there are many variations on this approach, they all involve some combination of the following features:
% My GA picture belongs here
\subsubsection{Chromosomes}
In the context of genetic algorithms, a chromosome is the complete set of model parameters that are necessary to fully define the model being optimized, in this case a neuron model.
These parameter sets are collections of floating point numbers, for example -65.7 for a reversal potential in mV.

\subsubsection{Genes}
In the context of genetic algorithms, a gene is a single model parameter.  Consequently, the number of genes in a chromosome is equal to the number of parameters in the model.
There are at least two stochastic operations that over time provide a gentle ``exploratory drive" for the algorithm, that cause genes to either double down on exploration of a local minimum, or possibly ``jump" out of a local minimum to realize lower error.  These operations are applied, with some user-determined frequency, with each ``generation" of the population of chromosomes, to determined the members of the subsequent generation.
\subsubsection{Simulated Genetic Recombination: Cross-over}
Cross-over is the exchange of genes between chromosomes.  In a population of many chromosomes, one can ``mate" two of them, producing off-spring which represent a fraction of genes from parent 1 and the remainder from parent 2.  If each chromosome represents two opposing vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube (for n model parameters), then cross-over is capable of producing offspring representing any of the other vertices in that hypercube.
\subsubsection{Simulated Genetic Mutation}
A mutation reflects a (random) change to a single gene, i.e. a change to a single model parameter.  In some implementation this is achieved by flipping one bit in the binary representation of the floating-point value of the parameter, with the magnitude of the resulting change in the parameter value depending on which binary digit was flipped.  Often mutations are limited to a particular range for a given parameter.

Later in this work I will talk about a property denoted $\eta$ this property controls the magnitude or step-size of gene changes made via either mutation or cross over. In the cross-over context, $\eta$ describes how similar child chromosomes are to their parents. In the context of mutation, $\eta$ changes the location of bits (from Least Significant position to Most Significant Bit). At specified bit locations the bits that encode genes are randomly toggled on or off in mutation.

\caption[Rastrigin's Function]{\textbf{Rastrigin's Function} Rastrigin's function is challenging to optimize, as it contains hundreds of local optima which would trap a gradient descent algorithm \citep{rastrigin1974systems}. This function offers a paradigm for testing and examining the capabilities of an optimization algorithm.}
\label{fig:rastrigin}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Local Minima} 
Many practical optimization problems have error surfaces that are not perfectly convex but instead are rippled, with multiple troughs of similarly low error value (local minima).
These ripples make navigating the error surface non-trivial.
Rastrigin's function \citep{rastrigin1974systems}  is a function for creating error surfaces to test the robustness of algorithms that attempt to overcome moderately difficult error surfaces that are densely populated with local minima, but with a global convex shape.
The surface described by the function is densely populated by local minima, each of which is placed on a globally convex envelope, such that the true minimum of Rastrigin's function is at its centre. As a certain number of genes are retained between generations, genes made on previous generations act as memories of previously experienced error surface. Due to this memory effect, the genetic algorithm is able to exploit the global shape of Rastrigrin's function \ref{fig:rastrigin}. It should be noted that there are error functions that contain no useful or learn-able information in the error surface. A satisfactory solution to such problems might still be obtained due to the exploratory and stochastic nature of the GA, however, much of the advantage of the genetic algorithm approach is lost, as the approach presupposes learn-able features about error surfaces. 

\subsubsection{Elitism}
The number of chromosomes (model instantiations) in each generation is typically fixed, with some chromosomes in generation $n+1$ coming from crossover of chromosomes in generation $n$ and others from mutation.
The remainder are often chosen from the fittest, i.e. lowest error, members of generation $n$, a strategy known as elitism.
The degree of elitism essentially controls the amount of evolution that is allowed to occur in each generation.

\subsection{Multi-objective optimization} 
Multi-objective optimization problems are a subset of optimization problems.
In a multi-objective optimization, model fitness is evaluated using multiple ``objective functions" of model fitness, each contributing either independently or in conjunction to the error surface.
Each function may ask a different question about the model; for example, one may ask how well the model reproduces the shapes of action potentials, and another function may ask how well the model reproduces the counts of action potentials.
The output of each such function is a scalar, with a lower values representing greater model/data agreement, i.e. lower error.
These functions are sometimes called constraints. 

\subsubsection{Weighted optimization} 
A simple strategy is to turn a multi-objective optimization problem into a single objective optimization problem, for example by summing the outputs of objective functions together. 
This is an common strategy, but this approach comes with a significant price.
Optimization using a sum over multiple error measurements leads to a situation where a single constraint has an especially deep error surface, such that the gradient of the overall summed error surface is dominated by that single constraint.
In other words, minimizing overall error mostly corresponds to satisfying only one constraint.
The optimizer invests most of its search effort achieving a low error on one constraint, leaving the others unacceptably high.
This problem can in principle be ameliorated by re-scaling the objective functions to have similarly deep error surfaces, but in general the shapes of the error surfaces cannot be known in advance, so this sort of approach cannot generalize.

\subsubsection{Non-dominated Sort} 
A less appreciated but perhaps more important drawback to collapsing multiple objectives to a single one is that it imposes an opinion about the relative importance of each objective.
However, while there may underlying ``true values" for measured biological variables, there is no underlying truth about which variables are more important than others.
In problems where not all measurements can be perfectly replicated by models (in part because the models are simplifications of biology), this problem becomes even more pressing.
The experimental data may also come from multiple data sources, leading to solutions for a single objective that reflect the diversity of the underlying system (e.g. physiological diversity of neurons of a given type), which is lost with the collapse to a single objective.

A multi-objective optimization paradigm that admits diverse sets of solutions to a list of constraints might better reflect biology, while also imposing less opinion about which measurements are most important.
The so-called ``non-dominated sort" is one such paradigm.
This approach considers each objective function separately, and only considers one chromosome to be superior to another if it ``dominates" that other, meaning that the objective function output is lower (i.e. smaller error) for each objective function.
If even a single objective function has a larger value for the latter chromosome, then it is not dominated.  Any chromosome that is not dominated by any other chromosome is considered ``non-dominated" and is retained (i.e. for mutation, cross-over, or elitist selection) into the next generation.

The non-dominated set of chromosomes has a simple interpretation: each of its members would minimize a single, weighted objective function for some set of weights.
If no other chromosome has strictly equal-or-lower objective function evaluation for all constraints, then there exists a linear combination of weights which would give that chromosome the minimal evaluation (minimal error, maximal fitness) across the entire population.
Thus, retaining this population is equivalent to retaining all possible ``opinions" about appropriate weights for the entire optimization process.

The NSGA2 algorithm \citep{deb2000fast} is a common implementation of this strategy, and is used throughout this work. Its performance can be compared to, for example, an exhaustive ``grid search" across sets of model parameters, at least in low dimensions.  

\subsection{The Curse of Dimensionality}
Brute-force exploration of parameter space requires computation time that scales exponentially with the number of parameters.  In contrast, more efficient searches can be polynomial (e.g. linear or quadratic) in dimension number.  However, if constraints are weak, or conflicting, or the error surface is especially non-convex, many of these gains are lost, and exponential search times may return.  Thus, there is no guarantee in advance that reduced model optimization, with existing experimental data, is a problem that can be solved in reasonable time for sufficiently high-dimensional reduced models.

% First include a section about NeuronUnit more generally.  NeuronUnit really isn't/wasn't about optimization until your thesis.  
\section{Data Fitting and Optimization with NeuronUnit}
\label{sec:neuronunit}
The ASU ICON laboratory previously developed a Python package called ``SciUnit" for scoring scientific models according to their agreement with various experimentally-derived data (encoded as ``validation tests") \citep{omar2014collaborative}.  The objective functions that I use here are implemented using this scoring process.
In particular, I used a SciUnit-based Python library called ``NeuronUnit" which provides a number of such validation tests for neuron models, and I developed additional tests in the course of my research.

\subsection{Constraint Scoring}
The scoring mechanism within these tests determines the output of each objective function to be minimized.  There are many candidate scoring mechanisms, depending on what one means by ``the model agrees with the data".  Each first computes some summary of model output, for example the resting membrane potential, called a ``feature".
Here, the two most frequently used scoring mechanisms are: (1) compute the ratio between the model output feature and the experimental data feature mean, and (2) compute a Z-score reflecting the normalized distance between the model output feature and the distribution of experimental data features.
In both cases, the relevant experimental data distribution might be within trials, across trials, across recorded cells, or even across labs, producing many sources of hetereogeneity.
For example, resting membrane potential (measured in $(mV)$), may vary in some dataset according to a distribution with a mean and standard deviation of $(\mu,\sigma)=(-65mV,15mV)$.
The optimizer may sample a model (with some parameters) with a simulated resting potential of $-68mV$.  
NeuronUnit would then use these values to compute a Z-Score of $(-68 - (-65))/15 = 0.2$.
A model with a Z-Score of 0 would reflect perfect agreement with experimental data, and very low or very high values would represent poor agreement.
Our lab previously showed models can be scored on very large numbers of such tests, corresponding to experimental data for particular neuron types, and then used to build biophysically detailed neuron models for the mammalian olfactory bulb \citep{birgiolas2019towards}.

\subsection{Data Aggregation}
NeuronUnit thus converts a quantitative measure of model/data agreement into a useful error signal that can guide model optimization.
But a second function of NeuronUnit is to aggregate the relevant experimental data, in order to make  construction of the tests described above possible.
And a third function is to apply some signal processing and feature extraction steps to these data in order to produce something that can be scored.
These features were present at the beginning of this project, but I have extended them to cover more datasets and more features, as described in the Methods.

\section{Model Simulation and Exchange}

The NEURON \citep{carnevale2006neuron} simulator is a software suite that wraps powerful and fast ordinary differential equation solvers based in the C programming language inside a mixed compiled/interpreted environment targeted at research scientists. NEURON is somewhat analogous to older, analog circuit simulators;
however, rather than describing complex resistor-capacitor circuits, NEURON instead solves equations for the time varying membrane potential of multi-compartment models.

In contrast to reduced models, multi-compartmental models digitally encode the form of membrane tissue: cables of varying diameters and lengths that represent the morphology of neurons, and these cables support smaller scale representations of ion channels, and ion currents in the membranes.
These neuronal models can be coupled together into a network, where the electrical state of one neuron has an impact on the state of coupled neurons through synaptic currents.
Specifying the system of differential equations representing these neuronal morphologies, ion channels, and synaptic connections is complicated, but \emph{NEURON} makes multi-compartment neuron simulation efficient, convenient, and achievable.
Models expressed in \emph{NEURON} code are procedural in nature, and the code consists of low-level implementation details.
Procedural descriptions of models are difficult to extend and re-use, leading to a need for a declarative model description language.

NeuroML \citep{gleeson2010neuroml} is an extensible markup language (XML) tasked with describing these complex network models.
In principle, any simulator (not just NEURON) can execute a simulation based on a NeuroML file, so NeuroML models are readily executed across different types of simulators (ideally with identical results).
This facility makes NeuroML an excellent format for model sharing, and permits cross-examination of results if they vary across simulators, but also allows different modeling communities to retain the tools that they know best.
Because NeuroML is extensible and component based, it also incentivizes a ``plug-in" environment for re-using existing model components in large-scale models for different contexts.
These existing components may include reduced models, for example embedded into larger neural circuits. 

%Okay I can see the value in all of this now, but, I think that it should be linked together with other ideas. There are unstated reasons: Fitted models should be ported to NeuroML-2, and the optimizer should be able to act on NeuroML-2 files. 

Open Source Brain \citep{gleeson2019open} is a collaborative, model development environment based on the NeuroML format, which contains collections of model-descriptions and model implementations, along with tools for simulation and visualization.
These collections are well tested and understood, and the Open Source Brain platform was a practical tool for learning the Izhikevich models correct parameter ranges (which can vary depending on preferred units).
%OSB has also used to compare new model implementations to established ones thus verifying correct model behavior.

NEURON focuses on efficient simulation of multi-compartmental models, while NeuroML provides for model exchange. 
However, neither tool was designed with the optimization of reduced models in mind.
In optimization, the same model may be re-executed hundreds of thousands of times (with different parameter sets), so any computational overhead (for example, associated with reading/writing a file) is quite costly.  
There are other tools that may result in faster optimizations, but as I show here, even these are not optimally fast.
Consequently, it is best to think of tools like NEURON and NeuroML has useful for running and sharing optimized models, but not necessarily useful for the optimization process.  

\section{Analysis of Model and Experimental Variance}
It is common to observe large variations in measurements of a single electrophysiological entity from neurons of the same classification \citep{tripathy2014neuroelectro}.
For example, measured input resistance may be different when recorded from different cerebellar Purkinje cells.
Such differences may be due to intrinsic physical differences in cells (for example different surface area), due to differences in experimental methods across organisms or investigators, or simply due to the finite and limited number of samples available in the experimental literature.  
Aggregated data have been collected from mice, rats, marmosets, macaques, or even humans, where human data may have been collected under any number of disease states.

Understanding and modeling within-neuron-type variation should be considered an essential component of the scientific merit of computational modeling of a neuron-type.
However, the impact of this experimental variation on the production of neuron-type-specific models has not previously been explored.
Consequently, I will present here a large-scale analysis of the consequences of this variability--across many electrophysiological features--on the effort to produce canonical reduced models of several common neuron-types.
We would like to understand whether the space of existing or potential neuron models accurately represents the variability in the experimental data, and to help researchers map data collected from a number of experimental preparations onto a standardized rodent electrophysiological phenotype space.

\subsection{Relationship between Missing Data Imputation and Optimization}
Existing data sets are incomplete, consisting of a sparse sampling of cells in the rodent brain. By necessity, models are constrained using these incomplete data sets.
These missing data occur at multiple levels including exact neuron to neuron wiring patterns, un-sampled morphologies, unknown synapse activation times, and unknown axon and dendrite synapse locations.
More relevant to reduced models, even very basic information about spiking patterns in response to simple current injections may be unavailable.
However, since most fast numerical methods are incompatible with missing data, an additional component of model development--especially in the context of optimization--remains, which is the synthesis of plausible missing values.

\subsection{Closed Loop Development}
The speed of simulation is critical to successful optimization. However, even when using High Performance Computing (HPC) resources, errors may arise and require special handling or visualizations to diagnose.  These errors may even reveal errors in the model specification, but this may not be revealed until thousands of simulations have already run.
The ability to address and correct such mistakes requires rapid and verbose feedback during optimization, as well as simulations of sufficient speed to allow error ``breakpoints" to be reached in a reasonable amount of time.

\subsection{Successful Optimization} 
Integrating the above ideas, I aimed to develop a framework for rapid optimization of reduced neuron models subject to multiple constraints forged by experimental data, and to use this framework to optimize and share such models.
Here I will describe a number of methods and simulation experiments which demonstrate the successful implementation of many of these ideas, focusing on genetic algorithms that retain a diverse set of model parameterizations, potentially reflecting  within-type neuronal diversity.

The interactions between model constraints cannot always be known in advance, and in fact some constraints are mutually exclusive, either causing optimization to fail, or leading to a compromise. I also aimed to catalog such cases and use this knowledge to produce a more robust set of constraints, implemented via \emph{NeuronUnit} tests for future optimization work.

No model--including those that are published-- should be regarded as final.
Instead, I aimed to develop tools to improve these models by making them agree with experimental data, in the hopes that such models may be of general use to the neuroscience community in future work.
At best, replacing complex cell models with simplified models is a way to reduce the complexity of electrical brain activity to fundamental mechanisms \citep{teeter2018generalized}. At worst, simplified cell models may capture only a subset or a single aspect of important traits such as spike times \citep{hertag2012approximation}. %Many approaches to parameter fitting are limited to making models that reproduce spike times \cite{}

%A simple way to fit a model to an experiment involves computing the difference between modelled waveforms and recorded waveforms. Computing the root mean square error between the two vectors, might seem like an appropriate approach, however, the $RMSE$  will be unduly more sensitive to spike timing and not as sensitive to agreement in spike shapes that occur at different times. It's very possible that a neuroscientist may care more about modelling the spike shape, than the spike time, and to address this missing need, we have appropriately decided to extract spike shape features from waveforms and to use these as our distance metrics.

%When comparing two waveforms ``proportion of variance explained" $(VE)$ is often used to overcome limitations in RMSE \citep{schoppe2016measuring}. An alternative to this approach, is to select only a few electrical features from the recorded waveform that are deemed to be important, and to fit to those limited feature sets to experiments instead. A feature based approach to data fitting, is more likely to produce models that are not over-fitted, less fitted to noise, and models which generalize better. For example consider a neuron recording that contains $15$ spikes, and a model undergoing fitting to the data which has produced a waveform containing $16$ spikes. The VE of these two different waveforms might be quiet low, whereas the waveform shapes between model and experiment might agree on important features, such as spike width and height, and the voltage between spikes.


%We chose to fit models to selected electrical features of the waveform, instead of simply fitting voltage traces, by 
% direct qoute -- "Creating simplified models is a way to reduce the complexity of the brain to its most fundamental mechanisms. In addition to the benefits of clarifying mechanisms for single-neuron behavior, single-neuron models can be used in larger network models that attempt to explain network computation. Thus, many models of a wide range of complexity have been developed to describe and recreate various aspects of neuronal behavior3. For an in-depth characterization of the diversity of neuron models, see the review4, and for their capacity to reproduce spike times see ref. 5.."


There are currently many optimization packages for optimizing multi-compartment conductance based models \citep{friedrich2014flexible} \citep{bluepyopt} \citep{neurotune},  these optimization packages are exclusively intended to work with the \emph{NEURON} simulator. There are at least two packages for optimizing reduced neuronal models, but one the these packages is used to fit models to spike times \citep{rossant2010automatic}, not spike shapes. This optimization framework uses specialized hardware and software GPU and CUDA, so this solution is not accessible to the average neuronal modeller.

%to fit models brian2 uses never-grad a python genetic algorithm frame-work that is principally related to DEAP
Additionally, the Brian2 simulator supports some model fitting
\citep{brian2modelfitting},\citep{stimberg2019brian}. Although Brian2 can fit spike shapes by comparing traces, the type of optimization performed is not multiobjective, as it computes the the $RMSE$ of whole waveforms, and uses it as a single objective error function. Brian2 can also optimizes on spike times, but its not clear if it does this in a multiobjective context. Additionally, performance of brian2 was not reliable.

%or spike times plus spike shapes.

%To the best of my knowledge few or no python modules exist for the optimization of generic reduced neuronal models, that also optimize spike shape. 

Some core components of the optimization procedure detailed here do not deviate from those described elsewhere \citep{druckmann2008evaluating,bluepyopt}. These established optimization approaches use a multi-objective feature-based framework; however, there are several key differences. Critically, in this work we fit reduced models instead of conductance-based models, and this work seeks to formalize the quality of fits using Z-score, $\chi^{2}$ distributions, allowing us to compare the overall quality of data driven fits within and between model types. This allows us to answer questions such as: ``Does one model type lead to better fits?" and ``Are some \emph{in vivo} neuron measurements outside of the reduced model parameter's intended range?" %intended range for example a=[0.1,5]. Outside a>=5.1
Additionally, in this body of research we fit models using a novel range of electrical properties. One such property is the firing rate versus current (FI) slope, which is chosen to guide optimization because it produces models that are believed to be pre-tuned for use in networks. Models that fit the same FI-slope have the ability to fire at prescribed rates for a given amount of excitatory current. It is important that network neurons are calibrated in this respect, such that the behavior of the modelled network has  balanced firing rates and realistic interspike intervals.

Neuron models that behave like their biological counterparts are essential for computational neuroscience.
Reduced neuron models, which abstract away biological mechanisms in the interest of speed and interpretability, have received much attention due to their utility in large scale simulations of the brain, but little care has been taken to ensure that these models exhibit behaviors that closely resemble real neurons.
In order to improve the verisimilitude of these reduced neuron models, I developed an optimizer that uses genetic algorithms to align model behaviors with those observed in experiments.
I verified that this optimizer was able to recover model parameters given only observed physiological data; however, I also found that reduced models nonetheless had limited ability to reproduce all observed behaviors, and that this varied by cell type and desired behavior.
These challenges can partly be surmounted by carefully designing the set of physiological features that guide the optimization. In summary, we found evidence that reduced neuron model optimization had the potential to produce reduced neuron models for only a limited range of neuron types.

%For the three types of reduced neuronal model we were able to obtain models that produced mostly biologically plausible measurements, however, approximately one in every eight fitness constraints needed to be pushed towards the outer limit of plausibility, in-order to produce "all-round" empirically valid cell models. Existing model fitting approaches have succeeded in fitting reduced neuronal models to the onset frequency and exact times of neuron firing, in this work we sometimes fitted to spike timing, but we prioritized other electrical measurements in cells relating to membrane impedance, action potential shape, and current vs firing frequency relationships.\\
%In order to investigate how well reduced models can reproduce experimental data we executed numerical simulations, and coupled the simulations with a genetic algorithm workflow. We used data sourced from neuroelectro.org, and

% Fulfil and understand the limits of reduced model fitting and agreeing to experiments. As this reduced models are a canonical component of large scale brain simulations, and brain simulations could be improved if maximal model/experiment agreement was satisfied. 
We wanted to understand the limits of fitting reduced neural models to experimental electrophysiology measurements, and to use this knowledge to acquire the best possible fits between reduced neuron models and experimental electrical measurements.

as best as possible, fit reduced neural models to experimental measurements, and then to understand and describe limitations in models, that stop impede fitting and cause disagreement between models and experimental measurements.
of the agreement between reduced neural models and experimental data reproduce experimentally observed neural measurements.
Since This also involved exploring limitations in some types of neural data.
* Euclidiating the limits of reduced models and the limits of data, that impede model fitting.
* Euclidiating model measurement challenges (Rheobase as a soft constraint, threshold computations).

METHODS the methods were numerical simulations of neurons that were integrated into a system of genetic algorithm optimization. We used data sourced from neuroelectro.org, and combined it with a selection custom written differential equation solvers for the AdExp, Izhi models. We used NeuronUnit and standard deviations to compute normalized Z-scores 

% It is not novel to embed numerical model simulation inside genetic algorithms, but it is novel recompute rheobase at every sampled model parameter set, and thus to promote a diverse array of model types to the possibility of single spike waveform shape checking.

* The methods were using a genetic algorithms to solve multiobjective optimization problem. Forward euler solvers

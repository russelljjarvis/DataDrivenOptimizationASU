Several constraining factors dominate the design of large scale network simulations of the brain, these are: simulation time, empirical validity, understand-ability and reproducibility. A class of digital neuronal models: "Reduced Neural models", are faster accurate and easier to understand, than multicompartment conductance based models. Reduced models are one of multiple model types used in brain simulations, and they are often utilized on a scale, when poorer standards of model/experiment agreement seem tolerable. Large scale cortical brain simulations could be improved if higher standards of model/experiment agreement were satisfied in these models, allowing large scale brain simulations to be more accurate for the same rapid performance. We used numerical simulations on reduced models inside a genetic algorithm data fitting framework in order to explore the upper limit of model/experimental agreement, and to obtain experimental fits at the highest possible quality. For the three types of reduced neuronal model we were able to obtain models that produced mostly biologically plausible measurements, but almost always one out of eight fitness criteria needed to score poorly in-order to produce an empirically valid cell model. Unsurprisingly Reduced neuronal models were found not to be unlimited in flexibility.\\

In order to investigate how well reduced models can reproduce experimental data we ran numerical simulations of neurons that were embedded into a system of genetic algorithm optimization. We used data sourced from neuroelectro.org, and combined it with a selection custom written differential equation solvers for the Adaptive Exponential, Izhikevich, and simple conductance based models.\\

Among alternative models such as Point-process spike chain surrogates, and  multi compartment conductance models, reduced neuronal models are most often the faster to execute, and easier to understand. Three subtypes of reduced neuronal models, represent a midway point, in terms of their ability to faithfully reproduce experimental findings.

\section{A Web Application for Optimization and Visualization}
An application was developed using the reduced model neural model optimizer as flexible backend. %Since the optimizer essentially acts like the backend of a program, creating an application simply meant writing a "front-end".\\
\\
A python library "streamlit" facilitates the construction of web applications. Fortunately for the developer, coding in this web frame work requires no handling of html elements, and streamlit has tools for converting python data into interactive tables and plots. By abstracting html out of the workflow streamlit makes the front-end development accessible to time-poor backend developers.\\

When optimization is complete, the user sees the $\chi^{2}$ statistic, the $p$-$value$. The user is then able to follow a link to download the "model". Later the user will be able to download the full NeuroML model specification.

For each sciunit score in a suite, the Z-scores are visualized as an appropriately placed point on a bell curve. In addition to the $\chi^{2}$ test, this enables users to see how well the model does per test, on features that they may care more about.

The user then has the option of consulting displayed Z-scores, for each test.

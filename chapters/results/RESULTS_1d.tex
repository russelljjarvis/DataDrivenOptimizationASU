Previously, the INCF hosted a model data fitting competition, were participants competed to submit models that were best able to fit membrane voltage from a variety of above-threshold current injection experiments. In this competition, unlike in this work the best models had to predict spike time. Within the scope of this project, post-optimization, ranking of the different models in terms of their ability to explain the most in-vivo experiments.  There are some data sources, that no models seem to do well on, however, the majority of experiments cause good fits, and the models should compete with each other.

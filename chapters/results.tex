\chapter{RESULTS}
In the Results section I hope to help the reader understand what I discovered about optimization of reduce neuron models.
How well did it work?
What do these optimized models look like?
And is it possible to improve existing published models via optimization?

In section \ref{sec:optimizer-verification}, I show how well and under what circumstances the optimizer can work on recovering ground-truth model parameters using simulated data as input.
This is an essential step, since if an model optimized on simulated data does not match the model that simulated it, the whole enterprise can be called into question.

In section \ref{sec:limitations-of-optimization}, I use various suites of biological-data-driven tests to optimize reduced models corresponding to real neuron types.
I show how some of the assumptions and methodological approaches underlying the a subset of the tests might be problematic, and determine their impact on optimization quality. 

In section \ref{sec:optimization-performance} and \ref{sec:optimized-single-neurons}, I assess the quality of these optimizations. 
While I focus on representative cases in this section, an exhaustive account of all optimized models is also available in the Appendix.
I show which models lead to the best fits overall, and for which neuron types.

In section \ref{sec:optimizing-published-models}, I show that most published models actually deviate significantly from biological experimental data.
I locate specific features underlying this disagreement, and explain how this creates an opportunity for optimization to close the gap.
I then show that optimization can bring the behavior of the model and biological neuron back into agreement.

Finally, in section \ref{sec:web-app}, I demonstrate an novel web application for optimization that I created to showcase the work described in the other sections.
This web application can be used to setup, execute, and visualize optimization in real applications or to teach the relevant technical concepts to trainees.

%Test combinations that worked and did not work.
%note move the majority to the appendix
%Moved to appendix, will move back specific results
% Put some of the below (whatever is worthwhile) into Results section 1b




%    2a. First just do basic ones (like Izhikevich) for a few cell types, then you can close with L5PC.
%    2b. The app (which supports 2a).

% The optimized models part of this section is predicated on result 1b (so that optimization results can be believed).  You already have the poster for this. I think this captures most of your results in three themes.  Other results which are really methods, like parallel rheobase search, can stay in the methods, and you will get credit for them there.


% , although some pre-existing APIs already existed, I needed to write new ones.  This is in a sense a method, but you can still report that these tests are runnable, even outside of optimization.
 %Why (briefly, saving some for discussion)?  NeuroElectro vs Allen also belong here, and fits in with 1a.  You should talk about model means vs means of models (or whatever we are calling it) 
       
  %here, if you have the results for it or think you can in 3 weeks.  
       %You can talk about rippled error surfaces — this is such a deep technical detail that I wouldn’t spend a lot of time on it.  In other words it may be important but it will be almost impossible to follow even if written well.

\chapter{Results}
Is Optimization possible?
       1a. Construction of tests from diverse experimental sources (I wrote the neuroelectro api and its use in neuronunit, and wrote the original Allen one, but you have put in work to create runnable tests from these and other sources).  This is in a sense a method, but you can still report that these tests are runnable, even outside of optimization.
       1b. Simulated data tests of optimization.  What works?  What doesn’t?  Why (briefly, saving some for discussion)?  NeuroElectro vs Allen also belong here, and fits in with 1a.  You should talk about model means vs means of models (or whatever we are calling it) here, if you have the results for it or think you can in 3 weeks.  
       %You can talk about rippled error surfaces — this is such a deep technical detail that I wouldn’t spend a lot of time on it.  In other words it may be important but it will be almost impossible to follow even if written well.
2. Results for several optimized models.
    2a. First just do basic ones (like Izhikevich) for a few cell types, then you can close with L5PC.
    2b. The app (which supports 2a).
3. Study of variance between models and data.  The optimized models part of this section is predicated on result 1b (so that optimization results can be believed).  You already have the poster for this.
I think this captures most of your results in three themes.  Other results which are really methods, like parallel rheobase search, can stay in the methods, and you will get credit for them there.

%Test combinations that worked and did not work.
%note move the majority to the appendix
%Moved to appendix, will move back specific results

% Put some of the below (whatever is worthwhile) into Results section 1b

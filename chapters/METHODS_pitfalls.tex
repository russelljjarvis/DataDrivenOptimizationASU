\begin{itemize}
    \item[-]
    \item[-] Error signals derived from threshold calculations.
    \item[-] A suite of NeuronUnit tests contained two threshold dependent measurements. These were spike half-width, spike height. The treshold was also used to comprize a NU test, so in total three $V_{T}$ measurements were used.
    
    \item[-] (Ephysiology Feature Extraction Library \cite{}) EFEL, Allen SDK, and Druckman all contain independently written algorithms for ascertaining modelled neuron $V_{T}$ thresholds calculation code. In all three feature extraction pipelines $V_{T}$ is computed by taking derivative of $V_{M}$

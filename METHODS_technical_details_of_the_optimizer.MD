Model/Test combinations

Contrast with other optimization approaches:

* Other optimizers, rheobase current injection used is a hard constraint.
*  Rheobase value as a soft constraint. This means that current injection values are a variable model parameter. The exact value of current used is determined via exploring the model response to current injections of varying amplitude. The exact value, its value is determined by other model parameters.

* spike shape measurements and error functions. We used a set of 8 different experimental measurements NeuronUnit.

# Poor model Performance.

* Within a reasonable parameter range conductance based models are usually close to experimentally observed measurements.

# Patterns of poor model performance in Phenomenological Models.
* many reduced neural models are far from optimal at any point in parameter space. Optimizing does not significantly improve aggreement. Optimizing does not bring model and experiment close to `Z=0`.

There is an order of magnitude difference. Between agreement in Rheobase values between the conductance based models and the experimental models. 

For instance conductance based models, tend to have default parameters.

What does it mean.

* In methods I discussed an approach to verifying the optimizer.
- Specifically, we showed efficient optimizer convergence, when constraints were derived from simulating experiments.

In a simulated experiment, existing models were instantiated using a randomly chosen model parameters.

<!--The reason for this exercise is-->

In the class of reduced neural models we are optimizing, are not arbitrary waveform generators. The models have intrinsic restrictions that prevent them from matching perfectly with experimental waveforms.

When constraints are derived from model measurements, intrinsic model restrictions no longer apply. Optimized models should match perfectly with the simulated experiments. Failure to match is indicative of two things.

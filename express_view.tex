Be sure to copy/paste as much as possible from your prospectus, especially for the introduction, since it was already reasonably polished so there will be less work to do after that. Do now.


\item  Try to organize your sections more hierarchically, so rather than just a bunch of bullet points for the Introduction, group them by topic, and order them how you think they should be presented to the reader.  

\item Also, you will want both a label general introduction and label general discussion, but also within each chapter you will need a mini-introduction that explains what you are aiming to do or show in that chapter and why. 

\item That mini-introduction can be essentially like the content of the first few cells of some of your notebooks, but you will want to make sure that every sentence is comprehensible to someone who has read and understood the general introduction but otherwise doesnâ€™t have much special expertise other than being a neuroscientists of some kind.
